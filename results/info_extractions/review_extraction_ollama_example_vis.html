Auteur Review - Interstellar 
I believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ 
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">to be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent</span>.  
His style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to 
face, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">artistically impresses the audience</span> with how the characters solve their problems. For 
example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters 
diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because 
this idea <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">is so farfetched</span>, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual 
discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on 
themselves and corridors spinning, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">without seeming unrealistic</span>. 
This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters 
during <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a</span> second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be 
uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space 
travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a</span> 
black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential 
planets. 
Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more 
opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, 
‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">seems like an inﬁnite sea of two 
feet deep water</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Not threatening at all right?</span> Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out 
that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">they have minutes to ﬂy away</span>. Nolan <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">further 
increases the stakes</span> in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for 
seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. 
At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a 
tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ 
which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I know. Mental.</span> 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and 
wonderful</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces 
them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth</span>. Personally, as someone who is 
bamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining</span> to repeatedly 
watch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">can only hope the technology portrayed 
will one day come true</span>. 
Overall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet 
another cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a fantastic score from world famous 
composer Hanz Zimmer</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands</span> as 
we stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.
