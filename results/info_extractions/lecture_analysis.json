Structured data is you know exactly the meaning about the row and column. Unstructured data is they will change. Okay? Sometimes you don't really know how to interpret them. Currently that the human generate content such as image, text, video, we consider them as unstructured data. Luckily with this AI thing and right now text, image, video already can be converted them into structured format. But you still need to be able to know.",

Like what we say that if you have the record in e-commerce store, like in Amazon. Because they have million of the records. But then you probably only buy 10 books before. So make your data in the million then become very sparse. So data are sparse. And sometimes in certain place, we will also talking about the resolution. And that part about sparsity, how to solving them, how to do the resolution, some of them will be in classification, some of them will be in the text mining.",
