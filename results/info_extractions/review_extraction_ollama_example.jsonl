For \nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \nplanets. \nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \nwill one day come true. \nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_f0061754"}
